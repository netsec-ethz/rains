rdig(1) -- A RAINS query tool
=================================

## SYNOPSIS

`rdig`  [@server] [options] [name] [type] [queryoptions...]

## DESCRIPTION

rdig (short for RAINS dig) is a tool for querying RAINS servers from the command line. It performs
lookups of the provided domain names and prints the results on the command line in zone file format.

## Simple Usage

A typical usage of rdig looks like:

rdig @server name type...

where:
* server: is the IP address or a name of the RAINS server to which the query will be sent. The
    address can be an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in colon-delimited
    notation. If the provided argument is a host name, rdig first resolves the IP address of that
    host before sending the actual query to this RAINS server. If no server argument is provided,
    rdig consults /etc/resolv.conf and queries the name servers listed there.

* name: "is the fully qualified domain name of the Assertion that will be looked up"

* type: specifies the type(s) for which rdig issues a query. Allowed types are: name, ip6, ip4, redir,
  deleg, nameset, cert, srv, regr, regt, infra, extra, next. If no type argument is provided, the
  type is set to ip6.

## OPTIONS

* `-p`, `--port`: is the port number that rdig will send its queries to. (default 55553)
* `-k`, `--keyphase`: is the key phase for which a delegation is requested. (default 0)
* `-c`, `--context`: specifies the context for which rdig issues a query. (default ".")
* `-e`, `--expires`: expires sets the valid until timestamp of the query in unix seconds since 1970.
  (default current timestamp + 1 second)
* `-i`, `--insecureTLS`: when set it does not check the validity of the server's TLS certificate.
  (default false)
* `-t`, `--token`: specifies a token to be used in the query instead of using a randomly generated
  one.

## QUERY OPTIONS

RAINS supports a set of query options to allow a querier to express preferences on how the query
should be handled. RAINS servers are not bound to these preferences. Query options are to be set in
priority order, i.e. to specify query options minEE and minIL with higher priority on minEE, write:
-minEE -minIL. Each query option is identified by a keyword.

* `-1`, `--minEE`: Query option: Minimize end-to-end latency
* `-2`, `--minAS`: Query option: Minimize last-hop answer size (bandwidth)
* `-3`, `--minIL`: Query option: Minimize information leakage beyond first hop
* `-4`, `--noIL`: Query option: No information leakage beyond first hop: cached answers only
* `-5`, `--exp`: Query option: Expired assertions are acceptable
* `-6`, `--tracing`: Query option: Enable query token tracing
* `-7`, `--noVD`: Query option: Disable verification delegation (client protocol only)
* `-8`, `--noCaching`: Query option: Suppress proactive caching of future assertions
* `-9`, `--maxAF`: Query option: Maximize answer freshness

## EXAMPLES

Simple query for the address associated to the name of www.inf.ethz.ch:

rdig www.inf.ethz.ch

Querying the certificates which are used to authenticate connections to www.inf.ethz.ch:

rdig www.inf.ethz.ch cert

Finding the name `simplon` within the context of inf.ethz.ch:

rdig -c inf.ethz.ch simplon
